# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's `turtle` graphics module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eats food, and grows in size. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the screen borders or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Movement Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Scoring**: The score increases every time the snake eats food.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the screen border or itself.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game speed increases slightly as you score more points.

## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. This game uses the `turtle` module, which is included with Python's standard library.
